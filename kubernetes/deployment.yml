What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?
A Deployment is a Kubernetes resource that helps you manage a group of identical pods (your application instances). It defines the desired state for these pods â€” like how many replicas you want, which container image to run, and other settings.
    
    Why do we use Deployments?
    Automated Pod Management: It makes sure the specified number of pods are always running.
    
    Easy Updates: You can update your app (like changing the container image) smoothly without downtime, thanks to rolling updates.
    
    Rollbacks: If an update causes problems, you can easily roll back to the previous version.
    
    Scaling: You can increase or decrease the number of pod replicas easily.
    
    Self-healing: If a pod crashes or is deleted, the Deployment automatically
